      <h2 style="text-align:center;color:#ffffff"> Biography </h2>
      <p style="color:#ffffff; "> Hello! My name is Reina, I am 16 years old. I grew up in Stamford, but both of my parents are from Guatemala
      (so I consider myself Hispanic not American). I am the oldest of 3, including myself. My sister is 6 years younger and my
       brother is 7 years younger. I go to school at AITE, and I'm going to be a junior this September.

      <p style="color:#ffffff;"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that I had to problem solve the same way 
        I did in Scratch. It was essentially the blocks except you had to write it out yourself instead of dragging and placing blocks
        together. Scratch is pretty straightforward versus with Python you had to know the commands and such. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Debugging my program was a little frustrating. I wasn't exactly familiar with the commands and what I had to type in
        order for it to show up on the actual program. I enjoyed it once I started to understand how to do it but it was hard
        trying to direct the turtle on where to go.

        I learned the electricity will always try to take the lowest route or just the easiest route. We had placed the LED light
        on the same row as another wire and we found out that it wouldn't light up simply because the electricity went past the LED
        light and to the other wire.
