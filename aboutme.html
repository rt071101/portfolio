      <h2 style="text-align:center;color:#ffffff"> Biography </h2>
      <p style="color:#ffffff; "> Hello! My name is Reina, I am 15 (almost 16!) years old. I grew up in Stamford, but both of my parents are from Guatemala
      (so I consider myself Hispanic not American). I am the oldest of 3, including myself. My sister is 6 years younger and my
       brother is 7 years younger. I go to school at AITE, and I'm going to be a junior this September.

      <p style="color:#ffffff;"> Some similarities are that I had to problem solve the same way I did in Scratch.
        It was essentially the blocks except you had to write it out yourself instead of dragging and placing blocks
        together. Scratch is pretty straightforward versus with Python you had to know the commands and such. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Debugging my program was a little frustrating. I wasn't exactly familiar with the commands and what I had to type in
        order for it to show up on the actual program. I enjoyed it once I started to understand how to do it but it was hard
        trying to direct the turtle on where to go.
