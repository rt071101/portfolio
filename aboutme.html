      <p style="color:#ffffff;"> Hello! My name is Reina, I am 16 years old. I grew up in Stamford, but both of my parents are from Guatemala
      (so I consider myself Hispanic not American). I am the oldest of 3, including myself. My sister is 6 years younger and my
       brother is 7 years younger. I go to school at AITE, and I'm going to be a junior this September.
      </p>

      <p style="color:#ffffff;"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that I had to problem solve the same way 
        I did in Scratch. It was essentially the blocks except you had to write it out yourself instead of dragging and placing blocks
        together. Scratch is pretty straightforward versus with Python you had to know the commands and such. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Debugging my program was a little frustrating. I wasn't exactly familiar with the commands and what I had to type in
        order for it to show up on the actual program. I enjoyed it once I started to understand how to do it but it was hard
        trying to direct the turtle on where to go.

        I learned the electricity will always try to take the lowest route or just the easiest route. We had placed the LED light
        on the same row as another wire and we found out that it wouldn't light up simply because the electricity went past the LED
        light and to the other wire.

        My idea of robotics honestly didn't change that much. My definition of robots is also similar. I just thought that
        robots help humans do things more efficiently or do different tasks. Robotics isn't really my intrest, I suppose I'm
        exited about how it can help different people with disabilities in the future. Things that make me nervous are like
        self-driving cars because I don't entirely trust a computer because there are a various amount of things that could go
        wrong. Within my group, we all listened to each other and no one talked over one another. We also tried everyone's ideas
        and different processes of thinking to try and work things out with our circuit. Next time we could possibly try further
        trial and error to figure out some other ways to light up the bulb or a different way of completing a circuit than simply
        just the first way we do it.

        I learned that the robot sensors aren't too sensitive and sometimes it's good to do trial and error with some of
        the number to try and figure out how to make the robot move in the correct direction. My group worked really well
        together and we had a really fun time while working together. We also learned that some of us listened to the same
        music when we started to listen to an album by Little Mix.

        I learned that data travels across the internet in packets so that it's not just all the data going all together
        to the same place but pieces of data traveling in all different routes to get to the same place.
        <br>

        I would say that LaTex is a programming language versus a markup language. Although is allows for you to format documents,
        like a markup language, it's also used to write academic Math and CS texts which makes me think it's a programming language.

        I think I generally need more practie with everything. There are some things that I'm staring to get familiar with but,
        I do need help with a lot though I'm not getting everything completely. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I would like to add some personally things along with maybe animations and stuff with buttons on the page when a user
        mouses over things.

        They're good at data because they have specific ways at storing data and organizing it in different ways. Also, it because
        they are more efficent at searching through data.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would use a dictionary for something that I don't need in a specific order but I would use a list for something I need
        organized in a specific order. The similarities is that they both store data more differences are the syntax between the
        two.

        I'm proud that I figure out the code and what everything meant for the Bubble Sorting code. It was really difficult to
        understand, I knew what I was supposed to do but I didn't understand all the variables.
        <br>
        <br>
        The algorithm that was most interesting I think was the public key cryptography. I think it was pretty cool that each user
        has a public and a private key. I'm pretty proud of writing a sudo code to do a sorting code also because it was pretty 
        difficult. 
      </p>

        Some of the limitations are that I didn't actually finish my social network at all. I was still building classes so currently,
        it wouldn't show anything if I were to run it in terminal.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some features that would be useful are triggering commands within the program with just pressing a certain key on the keyboard.
        I would also like to try to maybe get someone to make one way connections. For example, like followers, if user1 connects with 
        user2 it doesn't mean they are connected. User1 would be connected to user2, but user2 would not be connected to user1.
