      <p style="color:#808080"> Hello! My name is Reina, I am 15 (almost 16!) years old. I grew up in Stamford, but both of my parents are from Guatemala
      (so I consider myself Hispanic not American). I am the oldest of 3, including myself. My sister is 6 years younger and my
       brother is 7 years younger. I go to school at AITE, and I'm going to be a junior this September.
