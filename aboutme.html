      <h2 style="text-align:center;color:#ffffff"> Biography </h2>
      <p style="color:#ffffff;"><a id="biography_section"> Hello! My name is Reina, I am 16 years old. I grew up in Stamford, but both of my parents are from Guatemala
      (so I consider myself Hispanic not American). I am the oldest of 3, including myself. My sister is 6 years younger and my
       brother is 7 years younger. I go to school at AITE, and I'm going to be a junior this September.</a>

      <p style="color:#ffffff;"> Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that I had to problem solve the same way 
        I did in Scratch. It was essentially the blocks except you had to write it out yourself instead of dragging and placing blocks
        together. Scratch is pretty straightforward versus with Python you had to know the commands and such. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Debugging my program was a little frustrating. I wasn't exactly familiar with the commands and what I had to type in
        order for it to show up on the actual program. I enjoyed it once I started to understand how to do it but it was hard
        trying to direct the turtle on where to go.

        I learned the electricity will always try to take the lowest route or just the easiest route. We had placed the LED light
        on the same row as another wire and we found out that it wouldn't light up simply because the electricity went past the LED
        light and to the other wire.

        My idea of robotics honestly didn't change that much. My definition of robots is also similar. I just thought that
        robots help humans do things more efficiently or do different tasks. Robotics isn't really my intrest, I suppose I'm
        exited about how it can help different people with disabilities in the future. Things that make me nervous are like
        self-driving cars because I don't entirely trust a computer because there are a various amount of things that could go
        wrong. Within my group, we all listened to each other and no one talked over one another. We also tried everyone's ideas
        and different processes of thinking to try and work things out with our circuit. Next time we could possibly try further
        trial and error to figure out some other ways to light up the bulb or a different way of completing a circuit than simply
        just the first way we do it.

        I learned that the robot sensors aren't too sensitive and sometimes it's good to do trial and error with some of
        the number to try and figure out how to make the robot move in the correct direction. My group worked really well
        together and we had a really fun time while working together. We also learned that some of us listened to the same
        music when we started to listen to an album by Little Mix.
